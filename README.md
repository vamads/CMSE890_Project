Project Proposal: Tracking the Usage of Scientific Instruments through Publication Data Analysis

I. Introduction
Scientific institutions rely on expensive equipment and instruments to carry out their research. However, tracking the usage of these instruments can be challenging, as usage information is often embedded in plain text and not presented in a structured manner. In this project, we aim to develop a machine learning solution to track the usage of scientific instruments by analyzing the astrophysics publication dataset from the Semantic Scholar research corpus from Allen AI.

II. Background
In order for scientific institutions to optimize the use of their instruments, it is crucial to track how often and in what ways they are being used. This information can help institutions to assess facility efficiency and more effectively respond to the needs of the research community. However, tracking usage information can be challenging, as it is often embedded in plain text but full-text searches fail as authors mention institutions and do not use them in the presented work.

III. Data Acquisition
We will use the astrophysics publication dataset from the Semantic Scholar research corpus, which contains approximately 15,000 publications. The data will be preprocessed to remove any unnecessary characters and to identify the most common words and word statistics.

IV. Exploratory Data Analysis
We will perform exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the data. We will create plots to visualize the distribution of the data, identify outliers, and analyze the correlation between different features.

V. Data Preparation
We will preprocess the data by tokenizing the text and extracting unnecessary words or characters. We will also create new features to better represent the data and to expose the underlying data patterns to machine learning algorithms.

VI. Model Selection
We will explore several machine learning models, including Multi-layer perceptron, Random Forrest, and Support Vector Machine, and select the best performing models for our task.

VII. Model Fine-tuning
We will fine-tune the selected models by adjusting hyperparameters and threshold values to optimize their performance.

VIII. Model Deployment and Presentation
We will present our solution in the form of a poster that can be used in future research conferences or workshops. We will also write a report documenting our findings and recommendations for the scientific community.

IX. Impact and Significance
Our machine learning solution will enable scientific institutions to optimize the use of their instruments and to assess facility efficiency. This will result in cost savings, increased productivity, and more effective response to the needs of the research community. Our solution can also be applied to other scientific fields and datasets, making it a valuable contribution to the field of machine learning.
